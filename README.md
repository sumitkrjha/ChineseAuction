# Auction

This repository contains the Solidity code for the problem "Chinese auction", also known as a penny social.

# Problem Statement

A Chinese auction is a fundraising event where participants bid on items by placing tickets in a bowl in front of the item they want to bid on. The winner of the item is the person who has the highest ticket number in the bowl when the auction ends.

# Assumptions

This implementation makes the following assumptions:

1. There are a fixed number of bidders, initialized to 4.
2. There are a fixed number of items to be auctioned off, initialized to 3.
3. Items are indexed from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of items for auction.
4. Each bidder buys just one sheet of tickets, each with 5 tickets.
5. The ticket numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3.

# How to use
To use this auction, you will need to:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Go to Remix IDE.
3. Upload the Auction.sol file.
4. Compile the Auction.sol file.
5. Deploy the auction contract to a blockchain.
6. Create accounts for the bidders.
